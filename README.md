# NewsCats - A feed app with cats

## What?

NewsCats is a cross platform mobile application written using ReactNative that allows the user to see a feed of fresh cat pictures and videos. It allows the user to store their favorites and share them with friends.

## Why?

It didn't seem to exist and was good practice for the authors and testers.

### Fabric/Crashlytics

Both the iOS and Android native codebases support Fabric. To enable it, specify the FABRIC_API_KEY and FABRIC_BUILD_SECRET vars in a file called 'env' in the root of the project. See [env.sample](https://github.com/fxdemolisher/newscats/blob/master/env.sample) to see how it is done. If you're contributing to this repo, please do not check in your 'env' file.
