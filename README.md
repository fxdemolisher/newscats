# NewsCats - A feed app with cats

## What?

NewsCats is a cross platform mobile application written using ReactNative that allows the user to see a feed of fresh cat pictures and videos. It allows the user to store their favorites and share them with friends.

## Why?

It didn't seem to exist and was good practice for the authors and testers.
